# Fly-To

## Description: 

Fly-To is a budget-oriented flight search engine. 

## Background and Overview:

Have you ever wondered how much of the world you can explore based on the dollar amount you have in your pocket?

Fly-To will give you a list of countries that fit your budget. Users will be able to view the result by region and airline carrier based on user input price.

## Functionality and MVP

✅ Documents have a page that includes an input form to specify a budget.

✅ Documents also support filters for a date range, region, weather, and location.

✅ Documents include a page where a map is rendered with a layer of location pins showing price at the location based on user input and animation of weather expected on the day of arrival. 

✅ Documents have more information stored at each pin that includes Dates, and forecast. 

✅ UI will also include a Dark Mode.
